Task 1
Numerically solve the differential equation 
y' = 3x -y/x, y(1) = 1
on the segment [1;2] with step 2 by the Euler method and the modified method Euler. Find the exact solution of y(x) and compare the values of the exact and approximate solutions at the point x = 2. Find the absolute and relative errors at this point for each method. Calculations should be carried out with four decimal places.
